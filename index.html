            While most parents say, “gaming is not important, a waste of time, and not good for our health,” 
            we aim to change that. For ages 18 and above, anyone can participate in the contest. Some parents 
            may register their sons and daughters with their CID Number and Date of Birth for safety. 
            There will be no harm or violence; police will be available in case any issues arise.
        </p>

            There will be a separate contest for participants below 18, with 50 participants, 
            who will receive half of the prize of the above-18 category.

        <h2>5 Benefits of Playing Games</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>1. Enhanced Cognitive Abilities:</strong> Gaming isn’t just button-mashing; it's a mental workout. 
            Studies show that video games can improve attention span, memory, and spatial reasoning. Action games, 
            in particular, challenge players to make quick decisions under pressure, leading to faster processing 
            speeds and improved reaction times.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>2. Improved Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Games are, at their core, puzzles waiting to be solved. 
            Strategy games and complex RPGs challenge players to think critically, analyze situations, and develop 
            innovative solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>3. Boosted Social Skills and Teamwork:</strong> Many modern games emphasize collaboration and communication. 
            Players work together to achieve goals, fostering teamwork, leadership, and strong relationships. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4. Stimulated Creativity and Imagination:</strong> Games offer opportunities for world-building, 
            character customization, and narrative creation, encouraging imaginative thinking and artistic expression.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>5. Stress Relief and Emotional Regulation:</strong> Video games provide a welcome escape from daily pressures. 
            Engaging gameplay helps players unwind, relax, and release pent-up emotions while boosting self-esteem.
